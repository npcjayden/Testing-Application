<p style="background-color:blue; font-size: large;">This mod was made out of boredom, but it could also be fun. Me and my best friend could only come up with so much stuff to do in a day before getting bored, 
  so we decided to make this mod and see what people think about it!
These cars are from the worst, to the best and finally back to the absolute goofiest of cars that look somewhat realistic.
 BeamNG modding is fast and fun. 
 The mod gets you to the garage in no time; while the engine pops and roars with every turn of the wheel. 
 You can also choose to keep it dead still if that suits your fancy, or simply enjoy its gradual acceleration as you drive along what ever map you're playing on.</p>
